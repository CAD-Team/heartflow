Discussion:
we need to find a different way of loading the artery.
Based on the boundary fitted approach results, we are seeing oscillations that didnt appear in the pressurized cylinder case.
this suggests the way we are loading (delta functions) is not good.

TODO:
- Change to discontinuous mat props at the interfaces.
- equivalent body force (pressurize the blood - with exactly the same pressure value)
		pressure = F/m^2, body force = F/m^3
		n_i p w -> p div u

- p=2, with plotting, incrased integration
- p=1
- blending mesh (2d bilinear?)
